# Installation of the programming environment

## Java:

### compiler and runtime environment
TODO

### algs4 library

Download algs4.jar

Make sure that it is available to your javac / java

Mac: Move it to [DISK] Library/Java/Extensions

Otherwise, place it somewhere, and make sure that you have the environment variable CLASSPATH set such that it is included, for example with ~/.bash_profile containing:

export CLASSPATH=.:/directories/to/file/algs4.jar

You can also look at the relevant page on the booksite and a more specific-OS-based explanation at the bottom of the page on the booksite for how to do this. Note the following:

You are not required to use the booksite's programming environment DrJava. It's what they do at Princeton, but you can do whatever you want.
You are strongly encouraged to write your Java code in a standalone editor and compile and run from the command line. In particular, we encourage you to not use an integrated programming environment (such as Eclipse). If you insist on using an IDE, you can do that, but you're on your own.

## Python:
### interpreter and runtime environment
TODO

### algs4 library

Look at the repository at https://github.itu.dk/algorithms/AlgorithmsInPython and install it into your local python installation by following the README.md there.

The documentation is available here.
